# IntroToDetectors
This repo contains my implementations of some common edge detectors, as well as a from scratch implementation of the FAST detector.

The FAST detector, while functional, doesn't support features like non-maximal suppression, and doens't support
the high-speed test or learning a faster method using a decision tree. This may be added later, but this
implementation is very much a toy implementation rather than a production quality implementation.
